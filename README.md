# About

This is a TeX template for generating a timeline of moderatorship of Stack Overflow moderators
(including their employment at Stack Exchange if they later hired).

The template is a fork of [the original](https://gist.github.com/normalhuman/bfc442e569676b48952a) created by [Najib Idrissi](https://math.stackexchange.com/users/10014/najib-idrissi).

The following color-coding scheme is used:

-   blue represents the time served as a moderator
-   purple represents the time as an employee of Stack Exchange
-   gradient on the right means that the moderator is still active
